This is a small sample ASP.NET Web Forms - WebFormsMVP framework project.

It was created to test and diagnose an issue of an mvp:PageDataSource SelectMethod firing twice, in conjunction with some validation event issues.

This is currently an ongoing issue as of 26th June 2010.

There will be updates to the solution, and associated blog posts once the problem is solved (/worked around).
